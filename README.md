**pySurgery** is a Python library for *computational algebraic topology* and *computational surgery theory*: it turns discrete data (CW/simplicial complexes, meshes, TDA pipelines) into **integer** invariants strong enough to go beyond Betti numbers—e.g. **torsion**, **cup products**, **intersection forms**, and (in key cases) **homeomorphism classification signals**.

If you’ve ever felt “persistent homology is informative, but not decisive,” pySurgery is aimed at the next layer of structure.

## Why this exists

Most numerical linear-algebra approaches over $\mathbb{R}$ lose information that lives over $\mathbb{Z}$ (especially torsion). pySurgery focuses on *exact* and *structure-aware* invariants:

* **Homology & cohomology over $\mathbb{Z}$** via **Smith Normal Form (SNF)** (captures torsion)
* **Cup product** (Alexander–Whitney) to extract intersection information
* **Intersection forms** for 4-manifolds (rank/signature/parity)
* Hooks for **surgery-theoretic** obstructions and higher-dimensional classification workflows

## Quickstart

### Install

Requires **Python >= 3.10+**.

#### Install from PyPI (recommended)

```bash
pip install pysurgery
```

PyPI package: https://pypi.org/project/pysurgery/

#### Install from source (development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabe-rbo/pySurgery.git
cd pySurgery
pip install -e .
```

Optional dependency groups:

```bash
# Topological Data Analysis integration
pip install "pysurgery[tda]"

# Mesh integration
pip install "pysurgery[mesh]"

# ML-oriented integrations
pip install "pysurgery[ml]"

# Everything optional
pip install "pysurgery[all]"
```


### Julia backend (optional, for large-scale exact integer computations)

pySurgery can offload some exact integer workloads to Julia (recommended for very large sparse exact-$\mathbb{Z}$ computations).

* Ensure `julia` is on your `PATH`
* Install `AbstractAlgebra` in your Julia environment:

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("AbstractAlgebra")
```

## Mathematical basis

pySurgery bridges discrete geometry to topological classification using several key concepts.

### 1) Homology & cohomology via Smith Normal Form (over $\mathbb{Z}$)

When computing homology,

$$
H_n(X)=\ker(d_n)/\mathrm{im}(d_{n+1})
$$

floating-point linear algebra misses **torsion**. pySurgery implements **Smith Normal Form** over $\mathbb{Z}$ to recover:

* Betti ranks (free part)
* torsion coefficients (e.g. $\mathbb{Z}_k$ factors)

Cohomology is computed via the **Universal Coefficient Theorem**.

### 2) Alexander–Whitney cup product

To classify 4-manifolds, surfaces intersect—cup products encode that intersection.

Given cocycles $\alpha, \beta$:

$$
(\alpha \smile \beta)([v_0,\dots,v_4])=\alpha([v_0,v_1,v_2])\cdot\beta([v_2,v_3,v_4]).
$$

Summing over a fundamental class yields intersection form entries.

### 3) Intersection forms & 4D classification signals

For 4-manifolds, pySurgery constructs the **intersection form** $Q$, computes rank/signature/parity, and supports workflows inspired by Freedman-style classification (with attention to needed hypotheses/invariants).

### 4) Algebraic surgery

Given a class $x$ representing a “hole,” pySurgery supports algorithmic manipulations that mirror algebraic surgery operations—checking isotropy $Q(x,x)=0$, finding dual classes, and updating lattice data.

### 5) Characteristic classes & spin structures

pySurgery extracts characteristic-class information from intersection-form data; using **Wu’s formula**, it computes $w_2$ (mod 2) to test spin conditions.

### 6) High-dimensional structure signals

In dimensions $n \ge 5$, classification interacts with $\pi_1$, Whitehead torsion, and Wall’s surgery groups $L_n(\pi_1)$. pySurgery includes tooling aimed at discrete extraction of group presentations and surgery-sequence-adjacent invariants (where computationally feasible).

### 7) Dimension-aware behavior

* **2D**: orientability/genus signals via low-dimensional homology
* **3D**: homology-sphere style signals and 3-manifold context
* **4D**: intersection forms + parity/signature style invariants
* **5D+**: surgery-theoretic invariants and $\pi_1$-sensitive obstructions

## Computational optimizations

Discrete topology can blow up combinatorially (e.g., large point clouds). pySurgery includes:

1. **Sparse fallbacks** when exact dense integer work is too large
2. **NumPy/Numba acceleration** for inner loops (e.g., cup product sweeps)
3. **Julia bridge** for large exact-$\mathbb{Z}$ workloads when Python becomes the bottleneck
